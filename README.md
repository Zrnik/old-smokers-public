# Hello everybody... 

...and welcome to source code of our 
Ultima Online: [Endor](http://endor-reborn.cz)
guild **[Old Smokers](https://old-smokers.cz/)** website!

**Note:** *The website is completely in czech language,
along with some comments in the code.*

**Note 2.:** *You will **not** be able to run this website localy or on the server, 
as it uses custom composer packages, that are only accessible with **my** github
access token, that you probably don't have. (Unless you make changes which would
remove usage of those packages.)*

Website is written in [Nette Framework](https://nette.org/), running on PHP 8.0.

Design is modified from [Cruip](https://cruip.com/), but the source codes 
for the build are not present, as the license does not allow me to include 
it in a public repository. I only included built javascript code and 
styles, as they are available on the live site anyway.

Authentication and authorization are handled by [Discord](https://discord.com), that has 
a publicly available, and easy to use API.

Website is automatically deployed to the production server by a github 
action and another action is also contributing to this repository you see
right now.

This is the best I can do, and I am open to criticism, if you think
something is wrong, please let me know!

My name is **Štěpán Zrník**, and I love programming, you can see my 
website at [https://stepan.zrnik.eu/](https://stepan.zrnik.eu/)
if you want to see more about me!
